---

An upcoming password manager built with modern cryptography and zero knowledge.
<br>We never see your passwords, and we couldn't even if we wanted to.

<br>

**OPAQUE Protocol** : Your master password never leaves your device, not even as a hash
<br>
**XChaCha20-Poly1305** : Authenticated encryption for every vault entry
<br>
**Rust & Tauri** : Native performance, no Electron bloat
<br>
**Proof-of-Work API** : brute force attacks made economically impractical
